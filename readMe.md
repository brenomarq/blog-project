# Blog Project

This project is based on the capstone project n.3 proposed by Angela in her course on Udemy.
On this repository, I'll be working in a simple blog application with no database implemented.
The user will be able to access the homepage and see their posts listed on it. Furthermore, they
will also be able to create, update and delete their own posts.
The technologies used to create this project are: - HTML, CSS, JS, NODE, EXPRESS and EJS.
